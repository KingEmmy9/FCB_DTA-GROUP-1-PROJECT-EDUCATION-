### EDUCATION
Educational Attainment and Personal Income data was analysed using Power BI. The aim was to determine if the level of personal income of the individuals is dependent on the level of Education they attained, and if the level of their personal income is also dependent on the individual genders and their various age groups., it was revealed that their personal income is not dependent on their level of education attained. It was observed that individuals with no high school diploma earned the highest income while those who have Bachelorâ€™s degree or higher earned less. In fact, these individuals with a Bachelor Degree were followed by children under 15 who earned the least.  
Furthermore, after analysing, it was discovered that the personal income of the 1,060 individuals is not dependent on their gender as there was no significant difference in the number of both genders as against their personal income. However, their personal income is dependent on their age group. It was noted that individuals within higher age groups earned more than those individuals within lower age groups.   


### COMMENTS
1.	Count of personal income by Educational Attainment.
The diagram illustrates the relationship between the personal income and the level of education attained of these 1,060 individuals. It was recorded that out of the total count of the individuals, 287 people who earned the most income were the percentage who had no high school diploma. This was followed closely by 263 people who studied less than a 4-year degree at colleges. On the other hand, just 14 children under the age of 15 were discovered to have the lowest income inflow. 

2.	Count of personal income and age
The diagram above represents the correlation between personal income and the various age groups. It explains the extent to which age group determines personal income. It was observed that 2 age groups, 18 to 64 and 65 to 80 had the same level of income inflow. However, individuals between 00 to 17 years of age have low level of income. 

3.	Count of Educational attainment by gender
The diagram reveals the level of educational attainment as against gender. It was analysed that the male gender has the most level of education attained at 50.28%. i.e., the male individuals in the data set are more learned than the females. Although the female gender came in 49.72%, we can say the difference is insignificant as their difference is 0.56. Therefore, their personal income is not dependent or determined by their individual genders.
